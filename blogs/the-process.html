        <p>I want to be successful in life and I want to drive a nice car, but I don’t want to be successful because of the money.  I want to be successful to prove to myself that I can do it.</p>
        <p>Something I’ve been working hard to cultivate over the last year is what I call The Process.  The Process is a lifestyle of hard work and dedication that I believe can only be accomplished by the individual on their own.  It’s an inner battle where the only enemy is the outside world. It’s not easy.</p>
        <p>Something I’ve been working hard to cultivate over the last year is what I call The Process.  The Process is a lifestyle of hard work and dedication that I believe can only be accomplished by the individual on their own.  It’s an inner battle where the only enemy is the outside world. It’s not easy.</p>
        <p>An example of that enemy in college may be partying. I know so people that have wasted semester after semester sliding by on C’s and D’s because they’ve spent every weekend drinking and partying.  I know people that have gotten 0.5 and 0.25 GPAs in a semester (true life) due to that lifestyle.</p>
        <p>I’ve seen people go through life just getting by, doing the minimal requirements to get by because they were lazy.  I don’t want to look back in 5-7 years and regret how I spent my time.</p>
        <p>To me The Process is striving each day to be the best version of yourself, and keeping yourself engaged in life…always wanting to improve…always bringing value to the table.  No one is truly excited about getting up early on a Monday, but you have to battle with that and overcome it, trust me it’s worth it.</p>
        <p>I’m not perfect, and I don’t engage in The Process everyday yet. But, it’s something that always sits in my mind, and with each passing day the foundation becomes a little stronger.  If kept up, that foundation will become fortified, and from then on it will be much easier to accomplish your goals.</p>
        <p>No one is perfect, and I’ve said that I’m not, but I believe investing in The Process and surrounding yourself with like minded individuals who don’t bring you down is the key to accomplish your goals, whatever that vision may be for you.</p>
