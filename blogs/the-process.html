        <p>I want to be successful in life and I want to drive a nice car, but I don’t want to be successful because of the money.  I want to be successful to prove to myself that I can do it.</p>
        <p>Something I’ve been working hard to cultivate over the last year is what I call The Process.  The Process is a lifestyle of hard work and dedication that I believe can only be accomplished by the individual on their own.  It’s an inner battle where the only enemy is the outside world. It’s not easy.</p>
        <p>An example of that enemy in college is binge drinking.  Many partake in it, and if you don’t many will judge you for it.  I like being social, but I also don't like wasting the precious time I have on this earth, and getting wasted every weekend is not something I want to spend that precious time doing.</p>
        <p>I don’t drink in excess because it’s not part of The Process. To me, The Process is starting everyday wanting to learn something you didn’t know the day before.  I have a reminder on my phone every morning “To Learn Something New Today” that I won’t mark as completed until I learn something new of value.</p>
        <p>To me The Process is striving each day to be the best version of yourself, and keeping yourself engaged in life…always wanting to improve.  No one is truly excited about getting up early on a Monday, but you have to battle with that and overcome it. </p>
        <p>I’m not perfect, and I don’t engage in The Process everyday yet. But, it’s something that always sits in the back of my mind, and with each passing day the foundation becomes a little stronger.  If kept up, that foundation will become fortified, and from then on it will be much easier to accomplish your goals.</p>
        <p>No one is perfect, and I know I’m definitely not, but I believe investing in The Process and surrounding yourself with like minded individuals who don’t bring you down is the key to accomplishing your success, whatever that may be for you.</p>
