      <p>Snapchat has taken the social media world by storm, and there doesn't seem to be any end in sight...</p>
      <p>Snapchat is a mobile application that was first released in late 2011. The basic premise is quite simple, you can send pictures taken on your smartphone to other Snapchat users that disappear after a set amount of time.  Often the life span of these pictures are no more than ten seconds. A user, like many other social platforms, can have a friends list much like your friends on Facebook or your followers on Twitter.</p>
      <p>The scope of Snapchat is directed at 18-34 year olds. They claim they reach 41% of Americans in that age range on any given day.  I’m assuming reach here implies a user that logged into the application at least once that day.  That data was taken from a Nielson survey in September 2015, but I would bet money that the percentage has increased to somewhere around 60% by the writing of this blog.</p>
      <p>Snapchat has three separate factors that I attribute to it's success. One is day-to-day communication between friends, insight into the lives of celebrities, and buzz news (I'll explain buzz news later).</p>
      <p>Day-to-day communication between friends goes back to the foundational inner workings that Snapchat was first released with.  For many of my colleagues, they use Snapchat as a new means of communication with friends.  In a world where people are constantly on the move, Snapchat allows connections between people to remain, while not taking the time that a text or phone call would take.  Small amounts of text are allowed to be over layed on a picture taken (about 80 characters), so small conversations can be kept up during the day. This is how many of my friends use the service; as a means to maintain often dull conversations with others that allow them to remain connected, but doesn't take the brain power of a complex conversation.</p>
      <p>Insights into the lives of celebrities and other icons keeps many coming back to the service.  One of the first major additions to Snapchat was the introduction of the Story.  This is essentially a place where a user can upload photos/videos that anyone who is a friend of that user can see fro 24 hours after their posting. This allows a user to document their day through photos and short videos filmed on the fly.  Since Snapchat is free to all to download, many celebrities took to the platform as another means of engaging with their fans and offering an "inside look" into their daily lives.  DJ Khaled is one who exploded back into the main stream media after gaining a following on his Snapchat, which often has videos of him riding his jet ski, or walking through the gardens of his Miami mansion.</p>
      <p>I consider news outlets like BuzzFeed and Cosmopolitan to be what I call buzz news, and they have taken to Snapchat in a big way.  Snapchat has allowed these companies to set up their own business accounts and post videos in the form of a “story” to their own section of the app called the Discover page.  Many of these give you a very quick run down of the most recent hollywood rumors, four ingredient recipes, and Top 10 style lists.  Most of these accounts post content on a daily basis usually totaling about 10 minutes worth of content to a user.  The major organizations that maintain a presence on this “Discover” page are Cosmopolitan, ESPN, BuzzFeed, DailyMail, People, Mashable, CNN, and WSJ.  There’s more that rotate through as they become relevant (such as the DNC and RNC currently).</p>
      <p>The final factor that has lead to Snapchat’s success is its sticking to simplicity.  In a social media world where giants like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram have resorted to letting algorithms choose what content a user needs to see, Snapchat has remained true to its chronological content delivery.  This gives user a sense of peace of mind that they’re not missing anyone’s content because a algorithm says so.  Their advertisement strategy has also remained quite simple and out of the way.  The only time ads are seen, they are seamlessly interwoven into a “story” as an often witty video to grab the user’s attention. The user can also immediately dismiss an ad with the swipe of a finger, as opposed to timed ads that YouTube and many mobile app developers use that stop a user in their tracks and often lead to frustration.  To a user they feel as if the ads are not intrusive because they are so easy to dismiss, but subconsciously the ad’s content is still being delivered, usually in the one second lifetime that the ad has before the user dismisses it.</p>
      <p>There’s many other facets and subtle aspects that have shaped Snapchat into what it is today.  If you’re confused about something, or simply want to know more, feel free to get in contact with me.  I use the service on a daily basis and have many friends in the millennial age group that use it on a daily basis, so I have a fairly strong grasp of how millennials utilize this product.</p>
