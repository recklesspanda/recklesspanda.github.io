        <h2>The Draw of Snapchat</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Snapchat has taken the social media world by storm, and there doesn't seem to be any end in sight...</p>
        <p>Snapchat is a mobile application that was first released in late 2011. The basic premise is quite simple, you can send pictures taken on your smartphone to other Snapchat users that disappear after a set amount of time.  Often the life span of these pictures are no more than ten seconds. A user, like many other social platforms, can have a friends list much like your friends on Facebook or your followers on Twitter.</p>
        <p>The scope of Snapchat is directed at 18-34 year olds. They claim they “reach” 41% of Americans in that age range on any given day.  I’m assuming “reach” here implies a user that logged into the application at least once that day.  That data was taken from a Nielson survey in September 2015, but I would bet money that the percentage has increased to somewhere around 60% by the writing of this blog.</p>
        <p>Snapchat has three separate factors that I attribute to it’s success. One is day-to-day communication between friends, insight into the lives of celebrities, and buzz news (i’ll explain buzz news later).</p>
        <p>Day-to-day communication between friends goes back to the foundational inner workings that Snapchat was first released with.  For many of my colleagues, they use Snapchat as a new means of communication with friends.  In a world where people are constantly on the move, Snapchat allows connections between people to remain, while not taking the time that a text or phone call would take.  Small amounts of text are allowed to be over layed on a picture taken (about 80 characters), so small conversations can be kept up during the day. This is how many of my friends use the service; as a means to maintain often dull conversations with others that allow them to remain connected, but doesn’t take the brain power of a complex conversation.</p>
        <p>Insights into the lives of celebrities and other icons keeps many coming back to the service.  One of the first major additions to Snapchat was the introduction of the “Story”.  This is essentially a place where a user can upload photos/videos that anyone who is a friend of that user can see fro 24 hours after their posting. This allows a user to document their day through photos and short videos filmed on the fly. </p>
