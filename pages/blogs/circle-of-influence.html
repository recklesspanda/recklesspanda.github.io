           <p>They say that you are the average of the five people you surround yourself with the most, and I’ve found this to be one of the most accurate proverbs of my adult life…</p>
           <p>Growing up I was not the most unique kid in the classroom.  Even through high school I would buy the same clothes everyone else bought, say the same things everyone else said, and try and act the same way everyone else acted.  For a long time I wasn’t too proud of this fact. I thought I was “spineless” and couldn’t think for myself or make my own decisions.  To an extent this is more than likely true, but I’ve learned how to leverage this negative into a positive.</p>
           <p>Reflecting on how I used to always try and emulate those around me, I realized that if I surrounded myself with good people I would start to pick up good mannerisms and habits.  If I were to surround myself with bad people, I would pick up bad mannerisms and habits.  These changes in myself would be subconscious, but they would happen nonetheless; and I realized they were not me just trying to fit in, but they were legitimate changes in my thoughts and ideals.  What this meant was that I needed to be more aware of who were in my circle of influence moving forward.</p>
           <p>This is not a selfish way to live.  It doesn’t mean that I’m trying to ride on coat tails or take advantage of others, but it means that I’m using the good people of the world as examples of what I want to be, and taking on their mannerism and habits because that’s how I seem to operate.  This also does not mean I’m running around burning bridges with anyone that isn’t perfect, but it does mean that people currently in my circle who are openly condescending or trying to tear me down are getting a second look.  It does mean that I’m trying to be more supportive of those that support me, and trying to be better to those who are good to me.  Your circle of influence is a two way street.  You cannot just take from those around you, but you must try to give back just as much or more than you are given.</p>
           <p>It sounds crazy, but I’ve only been truly aware of this phenomenon for a few months. But, in those few months I’ve seen a huge difference in my life. I now have more motivation and energy.  I’m pushing myself harder in work and my health, but pushing even harder for time with family and loved ones.  I’m wanting to succeed not for my own selfish reasons, but to make a true impact in my community.  I’m more interested in wanting to help and support others instead of just myself.  There’s been all these positive changes in my life, and I owe them all to those around me. Many of them will never know the impact they’ve had on my life, but thank you for all you’ve done.</p>
