      <hr>
      <p>It’s been said that you are the average of the five people you surround yourself with the most, an I’ve found this to be one of the most accurate proverbs of my adult life.</p>
      <p>Growing up I wasn’t much of a risk taker, and always did my best to fit in.  I would try and buy the same clothes as everyone else, say the same things everyone else said, and act the same way everyone else acted.  I found that if I surrounded myself with a certain time of person, I would start to pick up mannerisms and habits of that person.  This could mean good or bad habits, but in a sense I was like a color changing chameleon, whose color was dependent on my surroundings.  A lot of time was spent trying to emulate the “popular” people because I thought fitting in was the best approach to making it through high school.</p>
      <p>After leaving high school and getting through a few semesters of college, I began to realize that trying to emulate the “popular” people was not the way to go.  College opened my horizons beyond the scope of my high school, and even the scope of my college.  Through travel and interactions with new people I realized that there are many different types of people in the world, and that the “popular” people from my high school and early college career weren’t necessarily all that great as people.  I still had this chameleon effect that strongly influenced who I was, but I realized that being around “popular” people was not beneficial to myself, and this was the epiphany I needed.</p>
      <p>I started to be much more aware of who I spent time with, and I started to speak my mind more.  Like any great endeavor, it took (and still takes) baby steps.  It started with taking stock of who I was around and deciding for myself if they were someone who would lift me up or tear me down.  It started with introducing myself to the people I knew were good people to be around, but was too afraid to say hello.  It started with these baby steps, but over times those baby steps turn into big steps, and those big steps have helped shape who I am right now.</p>
      <p>Now this hasn’t meant burning bridges, or turning cold on someone for no reason. But, it means focusing the majority of my time around positive people, motivated people, people who push me, and people with vision.  I think our generation is in a position to make a huge impact on this world, but the only way to make it happen is for minds to be together, and I want to be one of those minds.</p>
      <p>This doesn’t mean riding coat tails or taking advantage of others, but using good people of the world as examples of what I want to be, and leveraging this chameleon characteristic I have to my benefit, and hopefully the benefit of others one day.</p>
      <p>In closing, I think we should all take a minute today to take stock of who we surround ourselves with.  Do the five people around us have our best interests at heart, and will they push us to achieve more than we ever thought possible?  Will they be there to celebrate the victories as well as fight in the trenches with you?  These are some simple questions I ask myself, and I owe all the positive changes in my life to the people that have made it possible.  To those people…thank you.</p>
