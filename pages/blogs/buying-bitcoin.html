I've diversified - my portfolio now has digital currency in it, and I have no regrets.<br>
<br>
Bitcoin, and digital currency in general, is an extremely confusing thing to understand, and I still don't have a firm grasp of how it operates.<br>
<br>
In it's most basic form it's just like an other currency out there - like the US Dollar. &nbsp;When you have a debt to pay, there's nothing physically magical about a piece of paper with a past president on it. &nbsp;The magic is that your&nbsp;debt collector can turn around and use that piece of paper to pay their own debts. &nbsp;They can&nbsp;buy gas, groceries, and provide for themselves with that piece of paper, so there's the value (i.e magic). &nbsp;Digital currency operates in the same way, except that instead of a piece of paper, its a string of characters on a hard drive.<br>
<br>
The difference between cash and digital currency is the scope of things you can actually do with it. &nbsp;The US Dollar can legally be used to pay any and all debts owed in the US. &nbsp;That's why we all like cash. &nbsp;Something like Bitcoin cannot be used to pay "all debts public and private" in the US. &nbsp;A digital currency can only be used when the other party wants to accept that currency as a means of paying a debt. &nbsp;Now, I know of pizza restaurants in New York and exotic car dealerships in Miami that accept digital currency, but your average business as of now would not accept digital currency. &nbsp;Right now I can't give Bitcoin to my landlord or use it at Kroger to buy my food. &nbsp;But, I can hold on to digital currency in the way I would a stock or bond, so that's what I've done.<br>
<br>
I purchased my digital currency through a San Francisco startup called <a href="https://www.coinbase.com" target="_blank">Coinbase</a>. They operate as an&nbsp;exchange, where USD can be used to purchase digital currency with either a credit card or bank account. &nbsp;My portfolio is currently 50% <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin" target="_blank">Bitcoin</a>, and 50% <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum" target="_blank">Ethereum</a> (another type of digital currency). &nbsp;I've had the "securities" for about three weeks now, and I'm currently up 7% since inception. &nbsp;Over three weeks, a 7% gain is better than any regulated security out there, but therein lies the problem with digital currency, it's not backed by an institution or government. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Not being regulated means a number of things. &nbsp;It means it's kind of a gray area on taxes, because current tax law doesn't quite spell out how to handle an unregulated security. &nbsp;It means your bank gets confused when you buy bitcoin through your cc or bank account - they don't know whether to charge a foreign transaction fee (fyi. they usually do to be safe). &nbsp;And most importantly, it means that if your Bitcoins disappear, there's nothing you can do to get them back.<br>
<br>
Since a Bitcoin is a sequence of characters in its most raw form, most people store them on an external hard drive they keep in a safe place, usually disconnected from an internet connect device because of fears of hacking. &nbsp;Since I bought my digital currency through an exchange, they handle all the backend of storing the character sequences, and in exchange they charge a service fee to purchase the&nbsp;digital currency. &nbsp;I like this because I don't want to deal with protecting an external hard drive, but if Coinbase declares bankruptcy, is hacked, or simply shuts it's doors out of the blue I'm really shit out of luck. &nbsp;Since it's not backed by an institution, I can't go to that institution to get my Bitcoins back. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
This happened a few years ago with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt._Gox" target="_blank">Mt. Gox</a>. &nbsp;Thousands of people were purchasing Bitcoin through this Japan-based exchange, but one day the company doors closed, the operation was shut down, and everyone was left without their&nbsp;Bitcoins and no one they&nbsp;could go after to get them back.<br>
<br>
Keeping history in mind, all the money I invest in digital money I consider play money. &nbsp;I don't bet the farm on it, because if it disappears I don't want my life's savings to be gone. &nbsp;But hey, maybe in a few days, I'll be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY86vH7z9qA" target="_blank">purchasing an Aventador</a> with the $100 bucks I threw to Bitcoin in 2017.<br>
<br>
