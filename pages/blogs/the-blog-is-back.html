      <hr>
      <p>Sorry for being gone for so long...<br>
<br>
Life caught up with me, and I haven't had much of a chance to get my blog started back up again. &nbsp;But excuses are nothing but words, so enough of those.<br>
<br>
At the beginning of 2018 I laid out some goals for myself under three main pillars: family, health, and wealth. I also got myself a white board to write all those goals down on and I've found it to help tremendously. &nbsp;I doubt many of you really care about my personal goals, but I wanted to let you know what this newsletter had in store for this year.<br>
<br>
<strong>Fashion</strong><br>
Within the past few months&nbsp;I've found myself really getting into men's and women's fashion, specifically streetwear. &nbsp;Having only basic tailoring skills and a sewing machine, I've begun a project of modifying existing clothes I have and making new ones. &nbsp;Right now the only piece I have made public is a pair of denim you can see on my <a href="http://www.stephen-ritchie.com" target="_blank">website</a>, but there's a few pieces in the works.<br>
<br>
<strong>Design</strong><br>
Another thing I've gotten involved with recently is interior design. &nbsp;Something I find especially cool is figuring out how to maximize small spaces like studios or odd size rooms for functionality while remaining pleasing to look at. &nbsp;I'd describe my overall style as modern-contemporary with a fairly monochromatic color pallet.&nbsp; If you need a visual of how I feel about interior design watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eJWKvkwBv0" target="_blank">this video</a> about Joe Sadler's house in LA. &nbsp;No idea why, but I&nbsp;think this guy is the coolest, and his house is awesome.<br>
<br>
Along with interior design I've also become very interested in urban design, and urban planning. &nbsp;As you can tell, there hasn't been much headway with <a href="http://www.stephen-ritchie.com/pages/blogs/introducing-project-lexington.html" target="_blank">Project Lexington</a> in a while, but that's because I've been struggling with how to best share my feelings and ideas about the city of Lexington with others. &nbsp;I'm currently working on recreating the immediate downtown landscape in auto CAD, so I think when that's done I'll be able to better convey what I'm thinking.<br>
<br>
<strong>Programming</strong><br>
I suppose with the right brain stuff above you have to include some left brain as well. &nbsp;My code project for the year, unoriginally named JARVIS, is going to be an all encompassing home automation and virtual assistant platform. &nbsp;I haven't yet made the&nbsp;"brain" of JARVIS, but I have been working on some widgets and smaller utility tools. &nbsp;In the future I'll be making the Github repo public if you want to keep up with the progress of the project as well.<br>
<br>
So there's a quick synopsis of what's in store for this year. &nbsp;From now on I will be putting out a new post every Sunday evening, so be looking forward to those. &nbsp;As always, if you want to know more about something I'm doing or just want to talk about an idea you have, feel free to <a href="http://www.stephen-ritchie.com/pages/contact.html" target="_blank">get in contact</a> with me.<br>
