      <p><strong>How many likes did your last post get? &nbsp;</strong><br>
I'm guessing you know the answer because you've checked within the last hour. &nbsp;I know that my last Instagram post got 21 likes, just in case you were wondering. &nbsp;So, what is a "like"&nbsp;and why the hell do we all care so much about them?<br>
<br>
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/05/smartphone-addiction-silicon-valley-dystopia" target="_blank">Justin Rosenstein invented the like button</a> at Facebook. &nbsp;He prototyped a system to send "little bits of positivity across the internet" by allowing Facebook users to "like" other peoples' content. &nbsp;This served a dual purpose - something fun for users to interact with, and&nbsp;a means of collecting a little bit more data on you, as a consumer, for targeted marketing (i.e ads).<br>
<br>
The idea took off like wildfire, and now every major social platform has a way to send those&nbsp;"little bits of positivity" to someone.<br>
<br>
With midterms coming up I've been cooped&nbsp;up in my room trying to learn and relearn 8 weeks of material; you could say the stress-o-meter has been&nbsp;elevated. &nbsp;I have&nbsp;found&nbsp;I'm&nbsp;constantly distracted by the buzzing or lighting up of my phone. &nbsp;Even if I turn on Do Not Disturb I'm still checking my phone to make sure I haven't missed something important, or gotten a like on a picture.<br>
<br>
<strong>Why do we want likes?</strong><br>
I think we want likes because we've been conditioned to crave them like mice in science experiments. &nbsp;The number of "likes" on a social media post are always front and center for us to see, whether it be on Facebook, Snapchat, or Twitter. &nbsp;These online giants know what they're doing. &nbsp;They've created an environment similar to sports where "likes" can be akin to points, and we're intrinsically&nbsp;wanting to have more points than the next person. &nbsp;This means we post more to build an online presence and a following, feeding the narcissistically driven appetite of the online giants.<br>
<br>
I've watched people mindlessly refresh an&nbsp;IG picture to see if it got another like, and I've done that myself. &nbsp;Every day in class I watch people retake a snapchat 3-4 times before they get the most attractive shot, and I've done that myself. &nbsp;Everything we do on social media revolves around getting "likes" and it may be doing us real harm.<br>
<br>
<strong>What are likes doing?</strong><br>
There's no historical data on social media related conditions because we're living the pilot episode. &nbsp;But, studies are coming out saying people are beginning to suffer from "continuous partial attention" where they can't fully focus anymore because the urge to check their phone is always "on" in their minds. &nbsp;To me, this doesn't seem all that far-fetched. &nbsp;My phone is always within 4 feet of my body.&nbsp; It's gotten to the point where I don't feel it in my pocket or even hand when walking around, but I know my mind is using some processing power to subconsciously keep track of it.<br>
<br>
<strong>An experiment...</strong><br>
With all this in mind I've decided to try something: for the next week, at the end of each night, I'm going to take a screenshot of the battery usage on my iPhone. &nbsp;I think this will give me a good indicator of how much time I'm spending using my phone's different apps, as well as how much time I'm spending on my phone throughout the day.<br>
<br>
I'm not going to change my habits for the next seven days&nbsp;to get control data. &nbsp;Then, during week two I'll only interact with my phone if it interacts with me through the form of a notification. &nbsp;The third week I'm going to wipe all my social media apps from my&nbsp;phone.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
I'm hoping that after three weeks I'll have some pretty scary data for how much time I spend on my phone. &nbsp;Ideally, during week three I'll find myself with a lot more time for productive things, like working out, getting ahead on assignments, or getting a full night's rest.<br>
<br>
I'll also be posting all the data on <a href="http://www.stephen-ritchie.com" target="_blank">my website</a> for everyone to see, so make sure to check in from time to time to watch the experiment live.<br>
<br>
Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go check Google Analytics to see&nbsp;how much web traffic this post is getting.<br>

<strong>The Results</strong><br><br>
<strong>Week 1</strong><br>
During Week 1 things went well. I didn't think any different about how I used my phone, but each night I took a screenshot of my battery use. &nbsp;I found that on average this is how things were shaking out.</p>

<ul>
	<li>25% Instagram</li>
	<li>17% Spotify</li>
	<li>17% Snapchat</li>
	<li>8% Safari</li>
	<li>5% Twitter</li>
	<li>28% everything else</li>
</ul>
<br>
<strong>Week 2</strong><br>
This is the week when I would only interact with social media when it made first contact with me through the form of a notification on my phone. &nbsp;This was also the week when things started to veer from the planned course.<br>
<br>
It started with forgetting to screenshot my daily statistics; mainly because it was midterm week and I was forgetting about most things not related to tests or papers. &nbsp;Beyond that I found myself itching to see what people were posting on Instagram, but I wasn't getting any notifications from the platform so I technically couldn't check. &nbsp;About halfway through the week I started to check my socials without it first poking me.<br>
<br>
<strong>Week 3</strong><br>
The final week of the experiment was a failure by my initial standards, but it was also the week I learned the most.<br>
<br>
I didn't stick to the original plan, which was to not use any social media at all. &nbsp;I was actually struggling to delete the apps because I was afraid I'd miss out on something really important. &nbsp;But instead of going cold turkey, I found a solution I think worked pretty well, which I'm still using today.<br>
<br>
To avoid FOMO (fear of missing out) I've turned on post notifications for the accounts I've deemed important. &nbsp;Most of these are accounts for clothing/shoe drops, breaking news, and my close friends. &nbsp;Now I can go hours without checking my phone because I know if something important comes up, I'll be buzzed about it.<br>
<br>
<strong>What I've learned</strong><br>
I've learned in the past 3 weeks is that I spend way too much time on my phone, but I've also found ways to drastically reduce the urge to check my phone. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
My overall focus has become better. &nbsp;When doing homework I'm not stopping every 20 minutes to scroll through IG or Twitter. &nbsp;This means in the course of a day I have more time to finish my assignments, which has helped my weekday sleep schedule immensely.<br>
<br>
Overall, this experiment has been interesting to take part in, and I'd recommend to anyone that they try something similar and see how they feel at the end of 3 weeks.<br>
