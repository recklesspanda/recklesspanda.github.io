      <p class="blog-post-meta">Developed Summer 2016</p>
      <hr>
      <p>This is a project that I developed while working for Lexington Catholic High School (LCHS) as a consultant. This was the first of two projects I've worked on for LCHS over the past two years.</p>
      <p>A few years ago the school implemented a Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policy.  This meant that students could bring personal laptops to use during school, and the IT Office was told it would help with student device problems on the side.  Shortly after the program began, the IT Office had issues with large numbers of students coming in throughout the day with problems.  In a department of only two people, they were having issues getting their work done, as well as acting as a help desk for students.  I was approached to help conceptualize, develop, and execute a plan to address this issue.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>The Plan</h2>
      <p>As mentioned above, the problem was the high volume of studentâ€™s coming into the IT Office throughout the day with personal device problems, causing the two person department to have to constantly stop their work to help each student.  With the constant interruptions being a pain point, myself and the IT Department came to an agreement that the solution would be some kind of self-serve kiosk where they could describe the problem they were having, and drop off their computer if need be.</p>
      <p>After a few meetings, the plan was to create a website a student could use as a self-serve kiosk.  The web-based dialogue would get all the necessary information from the student, open an internal help ticket within the IT Department, and then print a sticker in the IT Office they could stick to their laptop.  In the office there would be a table set aside for dropping these devices off at.  Throughout the day they would be queued up, and at the end of a day the IT Office could work through the issues for that day.</p>
